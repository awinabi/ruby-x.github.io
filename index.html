    <h2 class="center">Goal</h2>
		<p>
			The goal is to execute object oriented code without external dependencies, on modern hardware.
    </p>
		<p>
			No external dependencies means a system that defines an object oriented system language
			that compiles to assembler. A sort of object version of c, but without using c.
    </p>
		<p>
			It must be possible to compile higher level, dynamic, object oriented languages into this
			language, in a similar way that c++ is compiled into c (at least used to be). So ruby compiles
			to soml which compiles to assembler which compiles to binaries. <b>No interpretation.</b>
    </p>
		<p>
			Most of the system is defined in a higher level language (ruby) and only a small runtime,
			mostly for operating system acccess, needs to be written in the system language.
    </p>

    <h2 class="center">Status</h2>
		<p>
			A first version of the system language is now <a href="/soml/soml.html">done.</a>.
			The staticaly typed language is called SOML (salama object machine language), has a roughly
			ruby-ish syntax while c-ish semantics, and introduces several new concept:
			<ul>
				<li> Object based memory (no global memory) </li>
				<li> Multiple return addresses based on type  </li>
				<li> Multiple implementations per function based on type  </li>
				<li> Implicit type tracking using adaptive code</li>
				<li> Explicit <a href="/2015/06/20/the-static-call-chain.html">message and frame objects</a></li>
				<li> <a href="http://book.salama-vm.org/register/machine.html">Register machine abstraction</a></li>
				<li> <a href="http://book.salama-vm.org/object/instructions.html">Extensible</a> instruction set</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
    <p>
			An abstract risc like register level defines some abstraction from the actual hardware. The
			compiler compiles to this level, but a mapping to Arm is provided to produce  <b>working binaries</b>.
    </p>
		<p>
      There is also an interpreter (mostly for testing) and a basic
      <a href="https://github.com/salama/salama-debugger"> visual debugger</a> which not only helps
      debugging, but also understanding of the machine.

      The section on SOML gives an overview of the <a href="/soml/soml.html">system language</a>.

      The full documentation is in form of a gitbook and can be <a href="/book.html">viewed here.</a>

      The <a href="/project/motivation.html">about</a> section has some info of when and how this

      Last but not least, i try to get recent developments down on paper when they are still
      fresh, which you can read in the <a href="{{ site.posts.first.url }}">news</a> section.
