### Disclaimer

The som Language was a stepping stone: it will go. The basic idea is good and will stay, but the
parser, and thus it's existence as a standalone language, will go.

What will remain is traditionally called an intermediate representation. Basically the layer into
which the soml compiler compiles to. As such these documents will be rewritten soon.

#### Top down designed language

Soml is a language that is designed to be compiled into, rather than written, like
other languages. It is the base for a higher system,
designed for the needs to compile ruby. It is not an endeavor to abstract from a
lower level, like other system languages, namely off course c.

Still it is a system language, or an object machine language, so almost as low level a
language as possible. Only assembler is really lower, and it could be argued that assembler
is not really a language, rather a data format for expressing binary code.


##### Object oriented to the core, including calling convention

Soml is completely object oriented and strongly typed. Types are modelled as classes and carry
information about instance variable names and their basic type. *Every* object stores a reference
to it's types, and while types are immutable, the reference may change. The basic types every
object is made up off, include at least integer and reference (pointer).

The object model, ie the basic properties of objects that the system relies on, is quite simple
and explained in the runtime section. It involves a single reference per object.
Also the object memory model is kept quite simple in that objects are always small multiples
of the cache size of the hardware machine.
We use object encapsulation to build up larger looking objects from these basic blocks.

The calling convention is also object oriented, not stack based*. Message objects used to
define the data needed for invocation. They carry arguments, a frame and return addresses.
In Soml return addresses are pre-calculated and determined by the caller, and yes, there
are several. In fact there is one return address per basic type, plus one for exception.
A method invocation may thus be made to return to an entirely different location than the
caller.
\*(A stack, as used in c, is not typed and as such a source of problems)

There is no non- object based memory in soml. The only global constants are instances of
classes that can be accessed by writing the class name in soml source.

##### Syntax and runtime

Soml syntax is a mix between ruby and c. I is like ruby in the sense that semicolons and even
newlines are not neccessary unless they are. Soml still uses braces, but that will probably
be changed.

But off course it is typed, so in argument or variable definitions the type must be specified
like in c. Type names are the class names they represent, but the "int" may be used for brevity
instead of Integer. Return types are also declared, though more for static analysis. As mentioned a
function may return to different addresses according to type. The compiler automatically inserts
errors for return types that are not handled by the caller.
The complete syntax and their translation is discussed [here](syntax.html)

As soml is the base for dynamic languages, all compile information is recorded in the runtime.
All information is off course object oriented, ie in the form off objects. This means a class
hierarchy, and this itself is off course part of the runtime. The runtime, Parfait, is kept
to a minimum, currently around 15 classes, described in detail [here](parfait.html).


Historically Parfait has been coded in ruby, as it was first needed in the compiler.
This had the additional benefit of providing solid test cases for the functionality.
Currently the process is to convert the code into soml, using the same compiler used to compile
ruby.
