	Synthesis: An Efficient Implementation of Fundamental Operating System Services - Abstract
</div>

<div id="content">

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This dissertation shows that operating systems can provide fundamental services an order of magnitude more efficiently than traditional implementations.  It describes the implementation of a new operating system kernel, Synthesis, that achieves this level of performance.

<p>The Synthesis kernel combines several new techniques to provide high performance without sacrificing the expressive power or security of the system.  The new ideas include:
<ul>
<li>Run-time code synthesis - a systematic way of creating executable machine code at runtime to optimize frequently-used kernel routines - queues, buffers, context switchers, interrupt handlers, and system call dispatchers - for specific situations, greatly reducing their execution time.

<li>Fine-grain scheduling - a new process-scheduling technique based on the idea of feedback that performs frequent scheduling actions and policy adjustments (at submillisecond intervals) resulting in an adaptive, self-tuning system that can support real-time data streams.

<li>Lock-free optimistic synchronization is shown to be a practical, efficient alternative to lock-based synchronization methods for the implementation of multiprocessor operating system kernels.

<li>An extensible kernel design that provides for simple expansion to support new kernel services and hardware devices while allowing a tight coupling between the kernel and the applications, blurring the distinction between user and kernel services.
</ul>

The result is a significant performance improvement over traditional operating system implementations in addition to providing new services.
