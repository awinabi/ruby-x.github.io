				<h4>Syntax</h4>
				<h5>and meaning</h5>
				<blockquote><p> Pure OO, blocks, closures,clean syntax, simple but consistant, open classes<br/></p></blockquote>
        <p> Just to name a few of the great features of the ruby syntax and it's programming model. <br/>
          Syntax is an abstract thing, as far as i know there is no ebnf or similar definition of it.
          Also as far as i know there is only the mri which is considered the only source of how ruby works. <br/>
          With more vm's appearing this is changing and the mpsec is apparently catching up. <br/>
          As we are just starting we focus on oo consistency and implement only essential features. 
        </p>

				<h5>Crystal</h5>
				<blockquote><p> The heart of the ruby-in-ruby project is crystal, the virtual machine <br /></p></blockquote>
        <p>Crystal is written in 100% ruby</p>
        <p>Crystal uses an existing ruby to bootstrap itself</p>
        <p>Crystal generates native code, and ( with 1+2) creates a native ruby virtual machine. </p> 
        <p>Crystal does not interpret, it parses and compiles (just making sure that's clear)</p>
        <p>Crystal uses a statically typed value based core with rtti and oo syntax to achieve this 
            (think c++ with ruby syntax)</p>

				<h4>Core Library </h4>
				<h5>Parfait</h5>
				<blockquote><p> Ruby has core and std lib, with a slightly unclear distinction.
                  Parfait is a minimalistic core library on which this could be built. 
          </p></blockquote>
          <p>
            Stdlib, as Libc , have grown over the decades to provide overlapping and sometimes inconsistant features, most 
            of which can and should be outside such a standard component. 
          </p>
          <p> Crystal considers only that core which can not be suplied though an external gem, this is called
            Parfait. It only provides Array and String and an ability to access 
            the operating system, in 100% ruby.</p>
          <p>Full ruby stdlib compliance is not an initial project goal, but may be achieved through external libraries</p>
