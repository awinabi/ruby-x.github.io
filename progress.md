Some steps along the way
-------------------------

Since i forget easily i will write down some milesstones. Project start was around 10.4.2014

First Assmbly 
-------------

With the help of Mikko, there was start for assembler. Threw the parser, wrote lots of tests. First "hello" executable, written in dsl assembler, after 2 weeks.

First Parses
------------

With Kaspers great parsing library (parslet) was able to get up to speed relatively quickly. Thought it was impossible, but it's only very tricky. Lots of tests at first, then came a good "harness" for the stages. 
Parsing simple types, if and while, function definition and call, 2 weeks.

First Executables
-----------------

Going from the parsed ast to assembly was tricky, unknown territory. Uncertainty about right abstractions (eg, Values vs Variables) together with debugging by reading assembler, which i just learn 4 weeks ago, made it tricky.
Still, first executables after 2 weeks, hello, fibo, if,while and recursion after 3 weeks.
