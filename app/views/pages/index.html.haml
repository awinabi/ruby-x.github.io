    %p
      RubyX
      %b compiles
      ruby code to binary.
      %br
      In
      %b 100%
      pure ruby.
    %p
      The goal here is to prove that dynamic languages do not have to be slow.
      %br
      Only interpretation is slow, but when
      ruby is
      %b compiled to binary
      ,it can be really fast.
    %p
      How fast (X times), will eventually depend on the community.
      The RubyX approach works, but to create an mri compatible ruby will
      take many more man-years than i have.

      RubyX is here to

      The RubyX compiler is working, and the

      While the

      parses 100% of ruby, currently basics are implemented:
