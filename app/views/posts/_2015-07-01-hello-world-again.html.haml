%p
  After almost a year of rewrite:
  %strong Hello World
  is back.
%p
  %strong Working executables again
%p
  So much has changed in the last year it is almost impossible to recap.
  Still a little summary:
%h3#register-machine Register Machine
%p
  The whole layer of the
  %a{:href => "/2014/09/30/a-better-register-machine.html"} Register Machine
  as an
  abstraction was not there. Impossible is was to see what was happening.
%h3#passes Passes
%p
  In the beginning i was trying to
  = succeed "." do
    %em just do it
  %a{:href => "/2014/07/05/layers-vs-passes.html"} implemented Passes
  to go between them.
%h3#the-virtual-machine-design The virtual machine design
%p
  Thinking about what objects makes up a virtual machine has brought me to a clear understanding
  of the
  = succeed "." do
    %a{:href => "/2014/09/12/register-allocation-reviewed.html"} objects needed
  %a{:href => "/2014/06/27/an-exceptional-thought.html"} stopped using the machine stack
  altogether and am using a linked list instead.
  Recently is has occurred to me that that linked list
  %a{:href => "/06/20/the-static-call-chain.html"}> doesnâ€™t even change
  , so it is very simple indeed.
%h3#smaller-though-not-small-changes Smaller, though not small, changes
%ul
  %li
    The
    %a{:href => "/2014/08/19/object-storage.html"} Salma Object File
    format was created.
  %li
    The
    %a{:href => "http://dancinglightning.gitbooks.io/the-object-machine/content/"} Book
    was started
  %li I gave lightning talks at Frozen Rails 2014, Helsinki and Bath Ruby 2015
  %li I presented at Munich and Zurich user groups, lots to take home from all that
%h3#future Future
%p
  The mountain is still oh so high, but at last there is hope again. The second dip into arm
  (gdb) debugging has made it very clear that a debugger is needed. Preferably visual, possibly 3d,
  definitely browser based. So either Opal or even Volt.
%p Already more clarity in upcoming fields has arrived:
%ul
  %li inlining is high on the list, to code in higher language
  %li
    the difference between
    %a{:href => "/2015/05/20/expression-is-slot.html"} statement and expression
    helped
    to structure code.
  %li hopefully the debugger / interpreter will help to write better tests too.
